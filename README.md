# pocket-arc-backend

this is what i developed to go to the webpage that holds all business reports for us and grab the needed data from the lost business table to then share to the pocket arc app.

what is needed is for this data to be updated in the background every morning as ICM updates so agents are always kept up to date on lost business and can stay ahead on the paperwork needed to submit for business to be fixed.
